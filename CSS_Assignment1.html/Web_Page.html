        <label><b>Web Development</b></label>
        <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet
            (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text
            to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list
            of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
            development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
            configuration, and e-commerce development.

            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
            sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
            content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

            For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
            developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
            organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
            related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician.</p>
        <label><b>Web Development</b></label>
        <p>In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was  complete with its own features and HTML
            tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure
            authoring technique and is today an important aspect of web design.[5] The HTML markup for tables was
            originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using
            HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time,
            as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little attention
            was paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so
            with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table
            structures or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing.[6] CSS was
            introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout. This allowed HTML code to be
            semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved web accessibility, see tableless web
            design.</p>

Cybersecurity is the practice of securing data, networks, and computers from these threats.

            The methods used by hackers are constantly evolving, as are the security measures taken to defend against them. Failing to understand how your site could be targeted could result in disaster.
            
            As a result, a basic understanding of cybersecurity best practices is critical for effective web development. You should also carry out security audits on a consistent basis.
